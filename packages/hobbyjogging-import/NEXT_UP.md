# Next up: import package

No open import-package tasks. This file records what was completed and what
the package is still waiting on.

## Done

- **Quality review dedupe.** Quality fingerprints no longer include
  `source_record_id`; `record_review_item` dedupes by
  `(category, fingerprint, activity_id)`. The source record stays on the item
  for provenance.
- **`garmin fetch`.** Personal API client with shared bearer-token cache,
  paged activity list, ZIP download, atomic FIT extraction into
  `HOBBYJOGGING_FIT_DIR/garmin`, a `source_records` manifest, `--dry-run`,
  `--limit`, `--force`, `--fit-dir`, and `--since`/`--to`/`--days`.
- **Garmin VO2max.** `fit.py` reads undocumented message 140 field 7
  (`raw * 3.5 / 65536`) into `FitSession.vo2max_garmin`; `fit_import.py`
  writes `vo2max_garmin` at full precision; the FIT summary reports coverage.
- **Intervals plan horizon.** Planned calendar events are fetched through
  `max(--to, today + --plan-days)` (default 182 days); activities and wellness
  keep the original range.
- **Triage links.** `o` opens every available link; `ci` copies the Intervals
  URL and `cg` the Garmin Connect URL (resolved from the fetch manifest by
  file path, then by start-time match). `review show` prints both.
- **Time fields.** Intervals `moving_time` is stored as `moving_s` (recording
  time stays `duration_s`); FIT `total_moving_time` is parsed when present.
  Planned events get `duration_s` from `moving_time` and `training_load` from
  `icu_training_load`. The `moving_time_mismatch` quality rule flags a gap
  larger than `max(10 min, 25% of recording)`.
- **Triage Intervals re-import.** `(t)rust Intervals` re-fetches one linked
  activity with `force=True`: Intervals takes ownership of non-manual fields,
  conflicts on those fields resolve, and quality rules re-run.
- **Recording-time duration.** Intervals `duration_s` now uses
  `icu_recording_time` (falling back to `moving_time`). A duration difference
  within either source's pause gap is agreement, so Garmin/Intervals stop-time
  accounting no longer creates review items.
- **No-distance sports.** The writer forces canonical distance to zero for
  `treadmill_run`, `virtual_run`, `soccer`, `racket`, `training`, `other`, and
  `workout`; manual distance wins, and the quality rules skip
  `zero_distance` for them.
- **Planned-events sync.** `events sync` and the regular Intervals import
  reconcile planned events: fields are replaced (including NULLs), events
  that disappeared are soft-excluded, returning events are revived,
  manual/other-source events are untouched, and the summary reports
  fetched/new/updated/unchanged/removed/revived/skipped. `--dry-run` writes
  nothing.
- **Incremental `sync`.** Runs Garmin fetch, Intervals import, FIT archive
  import with `skip_known`, and the shared quality scan. `--no-*` flags skip
  sources, `--full` reimports all FIT paths, failures are reported per source
  and the command exits non-zero after continuing with the rest. The scan core
  is shared with `review scan`.
- Full FIT archive import and VO2max backfill have been run against the real
  DB.

## Waiting on

- **Runalyze enrichment** (blocked on API auth/endpoint details): comments
  merged into `description`, tags in `activity_tags`, gear via the
  equipment-categories endpoint, and `vo2max_runalyze`.
- **`review scan` prune mode**: resolving stale quality items whose current
  values no longer trigger them (not implemented yet).
- The dashboard is reports-package work.

## Notes / risks

- Message 140 is undocumented; Garmin can strip it. The VO2max line in the FIT
  import summary is the early warning.
- The Personal API activity FIT is byte-identical to the GDPR archive copy
  (4/4 activities tested in November 2026). The JSON `vO2MaxValue` is null;
  the type-44 `max_met_data` files are not needed.
- The manifest is a bandwidth optimization. The FIT importer is
  checksum-idempotent, so a redownload does not duplicate source records or
  laps.
